This folder contains students submissions.

Each student should:
1. Create a sub-folder, named with their student ID.
2. Create a `README.md` file in their sub-folder, with their name in the first line. Adding further text is optional.
3. To submit a practical lab assignment - add one file named `labX.ipynb` for every practical lab assignment the student's subfolder (`X` is the lab number, e.g. `2`, `3`). 

An example of how a students submission folder should be named and look like is provided in the sub-folder `123456789`.

It is important to follow these guidelines, otherwise you might be required to re-do the submissions for them to get graded.
