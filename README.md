This is the repository to which the CSCN8010 practical labs are submitted to in the first part of the course (up to the student success week).

### Setup
1. Fork this repository (this is critical, as it will allow you to push your submissions to Github)
2. Clone the forked repository to your local computer (`git clone REPO-URL`, where `REPO-URL` is the URL of the _forked_ repository)
2. Follow the instruction in [Student Submission Subfolder Setup](./students_submissions/README.md)
3. Commit and push your updates to your forked repository on Github
4. Note, you can use the same environment as CSCN8010, so no need to create another one
