# Lab 6 - Logistic Regression

1. Using SciKit-Learn, train a binary logistic regression model on the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html). Use all four features and define only 2 labels: `virginica` and `non-virginica`. See the logistic regression notebook presented in class for a demonstration on how to set up these labels (3 points).
2. Evaluate the model:
   1. Failure modes: in which data instances is the model wrong? (1 point)
   2. Are there any shared properties for these cases? (1 point)
   3. How is the model doing across a set of evaluation metrics: _accuracy_ and _confusion metric_. (1 point)
