# Lab 9 - Dense Neural Network

1. Using Keras Datasets, obtain the fMNIST data set. Explore and describe it as you would do with any new dataset that you start working with (2 points). 
2. Train a dense neural network using Keras (2 points)
3. Evaluate its accuracy. Report accuracy, confusion metric, explore specific examples of incorrect classification, and drew some conclusions from this exploration (2 points)
